# GTA Online Friends Cleaner

This tool is designed to remove friends who have been inactive in GTA Online for a certain number of days.

Friends with a hidden profile will be removed unless they are whitelisted. The same applies to friends whose last login date is unknown.

A whitelist with nicknames can be created in the user's personal folder: `%userprofile%\.gtao_friends_cleaner\` on Windows.
It must be a text file named `ignore_list.txt` containing one name per line.
